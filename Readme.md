# Git Sync

a Ruby hack for OSX that autosync a git repo every X seconds

warning: this is a horrible hack and shouldn't be used by anyone



## Install

- git clone

- add the bin folder to your PATH

- cd into the folder you want to start syncing

- gitsync start

    this will start watching this folder


- gitsync stop

    this will stop watching this folder (unloads and deletes the launchd agent)
